# Flatland
Simple version of Life game

## Brief
A very unlikely that this coding exercise would be interesting to anyone except author.
However, it has been my first experience in the following things:
* Linux
* QT
* Android
* CMake
* github :)

The most difficult thing to me was *scaling* and *moving*, especially on Android devices.
It took hours to understand how things work.
Perhaps I should have been read something in the web before doing this by myself...
But finally I'm glad that my formulas work although they look too simple and not impressing at all.

I've had fun with *CycleFinder* algorithm also.
Its final version is inefficient but seems to work (at least in my tests).
May be I will have time to improve it or *google* something better.

Project started with TDD but I had to switch to functional things only in order to get something in reasonable time.
